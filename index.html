        <h3>"Change is the only constant in the world" ~ Someone</h3>
        My First year at IITB was just amazing. So many first experiences that I can go on and on about.<br>
        I have changed so much and the same can be said about my ambitions and hobbies.
        <p>
        First, Contrary to my initial beliefs, I really enjoyed coding.
        Which is why I am currently exploring many of its subsections like Webdev, ML, data analytics
        and even game rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am also highly interested in the world of Finance and Economics and have been diving into its various
        sub/related topics such as stock market and investing and consulting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from these changing ambitions, have a look at my hobbies -
      <ul>
        <li>Beaches</li>
        <li>Sea</li>
        <li>Rivers</li>
        <li>Lakes</li>
        <li>Boating</li>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Scuba Diving</li>
        <li>Para Gliding</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, got a bit carried away but I just wanted to say that I love water sports and water.
        And the reason for this obbsesion is because *drumroll*
        I had slipped into a lake and drowned,just for a sec or two, when I was just a little brat,
        and that feeling was just mesmerising.
