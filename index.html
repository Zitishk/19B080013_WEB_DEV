            My First year at IITB was just amazing. So many first experiences that I can go on and on about.<br>
            I have changed so much and the same can be said about my ambitions and hobbies.
            <p>
            First, Contrary to my initial beliefs, I really enjoyed coding.
            Which is why I am currently exploring many of its subsections like Webdev, ML, data analytics
            and even game rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am also highly interested in the world of Finance and Economics and have been diving into its various
            sub/related topics such as stock market and investing and consulting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from these changing ambitions, have a look at my unchanged hobbies -
          <ul>
            <li>Beaches</li>
            <li>Sea</li>
            <li>Rivers</li>
            <li>Lakes</li>
            <li>Boating</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
            <li>Scuba Diving</li>
            <li>Para Gliding</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
